In this paper, we investigate the challenging long-term
visual tracking problem and its implementation on Un-
manned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). By exploiting the inherent correlation between Frequency tracker And Spatial detector, we propose a novel tracking algorithm, denoted as
FAST. As can be theoretically and analytically shown, the
superior performance of FAST originates from: 1) robust-
ness – by transforming from frequency tracker to spatial de-
tector, FAST owns comprehensive detector to cover consequential temporal variance/invariance information that inherently retained in tracker; 2) efficiency – the coarse-to-fine redetection scheme avoids the training of extra classifier and exhaustive search of location and scale. Experiments
testified on tracking benchmarks demonstrate the impressive performance of FAST. In particular, we successfully implement FAST on quadrotor platform to tackle with indoor and outdoor practical scenarios, achieving real-time, automatic, smooth, and long-term target following on UAVs.
