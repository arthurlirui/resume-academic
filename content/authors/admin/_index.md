My Chinese name is 李睿. Ｉ am currently a Ph.D. student in [KAUST](https://www.kaust.edu.sa), [Computational Imaging Group](https://vccimaging.org), working with [Prof. Wolfgang Heidrich](https://vccimaging.org/People/heidriw/). Before that, I obtained my bachelor's degree in [Xidian University](https://en.xidian.edu.cn/), School of Telecommunications Engineering, and then went to University of Science and Technology of China ([USTC](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/)), School of Information Science and Technology, as a master's student. 

Research: my academic research interests are using various image measurements (e.g., light field, polarized images, normal RGB images) for higher-level challenging applications, such as photo-realistic 3D reconstruction/representation, viewpoint synthesis, depth estimation, reflection removal via hierarchical representation of neural networks in large-scale data setting. 

Else: I am also developing high-frequency trading and algorithmic trading system on popular cryptocurrency trading [algotech](https://www.algotech.cc) as well as NFT for photo-realistic scene [capmake](https://wwww.capmake.com).
