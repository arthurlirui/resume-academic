Rui is a Research Scientist at Peng Cheng Laboratory, Dept. Broadband Communication. Rui got his Ph.D. from [KAUST](https://www.kaust.edu.sa), [Computational Imaging Group](https://vccimaging.org), working with [Prof. Wolfgang Heidrich](https://vccimaging.org/People/heidriw/), Electrical and Computer Engineering program. Before that, he obtained his bachelor's degree, majoring in Telecommunication Engineering, from [Xidian University](https://en.xidian.edu.cn/), School of Telecommunications Engineering, and then he went to University of Science and Technology of China ([USTC](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/)), School of Information Science and Technology, got his master degree, majoring in Information and Communication Engineering.

Research: his research focuses on using various image measurements (e.g., light field, polarized images, RGB images, CT) to solve higher-level inverse problem or application-driven problems, such as photo-realistic 3D scene reconstruction/representation, viewpoint synthesis, segmentation, depth estimation, reflection removal, etc.

My Chinese name is [李睿](https://www.arthurlirui.com/post/%E4%B8%AA%E4%BA%BA%E5%92%8C%E5%AE%B6%E6%97%8F%E6%83%85%E5%86%B5/) from [Liuzhou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liuzhou).
