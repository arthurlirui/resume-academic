My Chinese name is [李睿](https://www.arthurlirui.com/post/%E4%B8%AA%E4%BA%BA%E5%92%8C%E5%AE%B6%E6%97%8F%E6%83%85%E5%86%B5/)(Pronounce: Ray Lee) from [Liuzhou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liuzhou). Ｉ am currently a Ph.D. student in [KAUST](https://www.kaust.edu.sa), [Computational Imaging Group](https://vccimaging.org), working with [Prof. Wolfgang Heidrich](https://vccimaging.org/People/heidriw/). Before that, I obtained my bachelor's degree in [Xidian University](https://en.xidian.edu.cn/), School of Telecommunications Engineering, and then went to University of Science and Technology of China ([USTC](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/)), School of Information Science and Technology, as a master's student. 

Research: I am currently focusing on using various image measurements (e.g., light field, polarized images, RGB images, CT) to solve higher-level inverse problem or application-driven problems, such as photo-realistic 3D scene reconstruction/representation, viewpoint synthesis, segmentation, depth estimation, reflection removal, etc.

Else: I am also developing algorithmic trading system on popular cryptocurrency exchanges as well as NFT generation technology for photo-realistic scene.
