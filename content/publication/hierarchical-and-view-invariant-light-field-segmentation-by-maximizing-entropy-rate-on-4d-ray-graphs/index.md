  Image segmentation is an important first step of many image processing,
  computer graphics, and computer vision pipelines. Unfortunately, it remains
  difficult to automatically and robustly segment cluttered scenes, or scenes in
  which multiple objects have similar color and texture. In these scenarios,
  light fields offer much richer cues that can be used efficiently to
  drastically improve the quality and robustness of segmentations.

  In this paper we introduce a new light field segmentation method that respects texture appearance, depth consistency, as well as occlusion, and creates well-shaped segments that are robust under viewpoint changes. Furthermore, our segmentation is hierarchical, i.e. with a single optimization, a whole hierarchy of segmentations with different numbers of regions is available. All this is achieved with a submodular objective function that

  caption: "Our light field segmentation method facilities segmentation of fine
    structures in light fields with complex occlusions and difficult textures.
    Here we show from left to right: two source light fields, the achieved
    segmentation, mean color regions, and object selection (which requires
    additional user input). We also show the EPIs for different horizontal and
    vertical slices."
