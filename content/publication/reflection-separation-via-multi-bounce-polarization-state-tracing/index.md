abstract: Reflection removal from photographs is an important task in
  computational photography, but also for computer vision tasks that involve
  imaging through windows and similar settings. Traditionally, the problem is
  approached as a single reflection removal problem under very controlled
  scenarios. In this paper we aim to generalize the reflection removal to
  real-world scenarios with more complicated light interactions. To this end, we
  propose a simple yet efficient learning framework for supervised image
  reflection separation with a polarization-guided ray-tracing model and loss
  function design. Instead of a conventional image sensor, we use a polarization
  sensor that instantaneously captures four linearly polarized photos of the
  scene in the same image. Through a combination of a new polarization-guided
  image formation model and a novel supervised learning framework for the
  interpretation of a ray-tracing image formation model, a general method is
  obtained to tackle general image reflection removal problems. We demonstrate
  our method with extensive experiments on both real and synthetic data and
  demonstrate the unprecedented quality of image reconstructions.
