  Simultaneous reconstruction of geometry and reflectance properties in
  uncontrolled environments remains a challenging problem. In this paper, we
  propose an efficient method to reconstruct the scene’s 3D geometry and
  reflectance from multi-view photography using conventional hand-held cameras.
  Our method automatically builds a virtual scene in a differentiable rendering
  system that roughly matches the real world’s scene parameters, optimized by
  minimizing photometric objectives alternatingly and stochastically. With the
  optimal scene parameters evaluated, photo-realistic novel views for various
  viewing angles and distances can then be generated by our approach.

  We present the results of captured scenes with complex geometry and various reflection types. Our method also shows superior performance compared to state-of-the-art alternatives in novel view synthesis visually and quantitatively
